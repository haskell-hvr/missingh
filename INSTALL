=========================================

Please see the file INSTALL-win.txt for Windows platform instructions.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You must satisfy one or more of these major categories:

1. GHC 6.6 or above (including cpphs)
   (for GHC 6.4.0 or 6.4.1, use MissingH 0.14.3 or below)

2. Hugs 2005xx or above, plus cpphs

   If you don't already have cpphs, get it from
   http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/.

If you need Cabal, get it from http://www.haskell.org/cabal.

Debian users can install the packages cpphs and ghc6

3. GHC extralibs collection, or the individual
   libraries mentioned in MissingH.cabal

INSTALLATION
------------

The first step is to generate your setup file.  To do that, run:

  make setup

Now, for GHC:

 ./setup configure
 ./setup build
 ./setup install

Or, for Hugs:

 ./setup configure --hugs
 ./setup build
 ./setup install
 
Optionally, to run the unit tests, you'll need to install HUnit.  Then:

 make test-ghc6

or:

 make test-hugs
