{- | The type used for functions for 'wholeMap'.  See 'wholeMap' for details.
-}
newtype WholeFunc a b = WholeFunc ([a] -> (WholeFunc a b, [a], [b]))

{- | This is an enhanced version of the concatMap or map functions in
Data.List.

Unlike those functions, this one:

 * Can consume a varying number of elements from the input list during
   each iteration

 * Can arbitrarily decide when to stop processing data

 * Can return a varying number of elements to insert into the output list

 * Can actually switch processing functions mid-stream

 * Is not even restricted to processing the input list intact

The function used by wholeMap, of type 'WholeFunc', is repeatedly called
with the input list.  The function returns three things: the function
to call for the next iteration (if any), what remains of the input list,
and the list of output elements generated during this iteration.  The return
value of 'wholeMap' is the concatenation of the output element lists from
all iterations.

Processing stops when the remaining input list is empty.  An example
of a 'WholeFunc' is 'fixedWidth'. -}
wholeMap :: WholeFunc a b -> [a] -> [b]
wholeMap _ [] = []              -- Empty input, empty output.
wholeMap (WholeFunc func) inplist =
    let (nextfunc, nextlist, output) = func inplist
        in
        output ++ wholeMap nextfunc nextlist

{- | A parser designed to process fixed-width input fields.  Use it with
'wholeMap'.

The Int list passed to this function is the list of the field widths desired
from the input.  The result is a list of those widths, if possible.  If any
of the input remains after processing this list, it is added on as the final
element in the result list.  If the input is less than the sum of the requested
widths, then the result list will be short the appropriate number of elements,
and its final element may be shorter than requested.

Examples:

>wholeMap (fixedWidth [1, 2, 3]) "1234567890"
> --> ["1","23","456","7890"]
>wholeMap (fixedWidth (repeat 2)) "123456789"
> --> ["12","34","56","78","9"]
>wholeMap (fixedWidth []) "123456789"
> --> ["123456789"]
>wholeMap (fixedWidth [5, 3, 6, 1]) "Hello, This is a test."
> --> ["Hello",", T","his is"," ","a test."]
-}
fixedWidth :: [Int] -> WholeFunc a [a]
fixedWidth len =
    WholeFunc (fixedWidthFunc len)
    where -- Empty input: Empty output, stop
          fixedWidthFunc _ [] = ((fixedWidth []), [], [])
          -- Empty length: Stop here.
          fixedWidthFunc [] x = ((fixedWidth []), [], [x])
          -- Stuff to process: Do it.
          fixedWidthFunc (len:lenxs) input =
              (fixedWidth lenxs, next, [this])
              where (this, next) = splitAt len input

{- | Helps you pick out fixed-width components from a list.

Example:

>conv :: String -> (String,String)
>conv = runState $
>        do f3 <- grab 3
>           n2 <- grab 2
>           return $ f3 ++ "," ++ n2
>
>main = print $ conv "TestIng"

Prints:

>("Tes,tI","ng")
-}

grab :: Int -> State [a] [a]
grab count =
    do g <- get
       (x, g') <- return $ splitAt count g
       put g'
       return x

{- | Similar to Data.List.elemIndex.  Instead of looking for one element in a
list, this function looks for the first occurance of a sublist in the list,
and returns the index of the first element of that occurance.  If there is no
such list, returns Nothing.

If the list to look for is the empty list, will return Just 0 regardless
of the content of the list to search.

Examples:

>subIndex "foo" "asdfoobar" -> Just 3
>subIndex "foo" [] -> Nothing
>subIndex "" [] -> Just 0
>subIndex "" "asdf" -> Just 0
>subIndex "test" "asdftestbartest" -> Just 4
>subIndex [(1::Int), 2] [0, 5, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4] -> Just 4
 -}
subIndex :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Maybe Int
subIndex substr str = findIndex (isPrefixOf substr) (tails str)

{- | Given a list, returns a new list with all duplicate elements removed.
For example:

>uniq "Mississippi" -> "Misp"

You should not rely on this function necessarily preserving order, though
the current implementation happens to.

This function is not compatible with infinite lists.

This is presently an alias for 'Data.List.nub'.
 -}
uniq :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]
uniq = nub

----- same as
--uniq (x:xs) = x : [y | y <- uniq xs, y /= x]
