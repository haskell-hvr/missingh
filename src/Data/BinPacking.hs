Tools for packing into bins

Written by John Goerzen, jgoerzen\@complete.org

This module is designed to solve this type of problem: Given a bunch of
objects of varying sizes, what is the best possible way to pack them into
fixed-size bins?  This can be used, for instance, by the datapacker program
to pack files onto CDs or DVDs; by manufacturing environments to pack
physical items into physicl bins; etc.

A description of bin packing algorithms can be found at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem>.

{- | The primary type for bin-packing functions.

These functions take a list of size of bins.  If every bin is the same size,
you can pass @repeat binSize@ to pass an infinite list of bins if the
same size.  Any surplus bins will simply be ignored.

{- | Pack objects into bins, preserving order.  Objects will be taken from the
input list one by one, and added to each bin until the bin is full.  Work will
then proceed on the next bin.  No attempt is made to optimize allocations to
bins.  This is the simplest and most naive bin-packing algorithm, but
may not make very good use of bin space. -}

{- | Pack objects into bins.  For each bin, start with the largest objects,
and keep packing the largest object from the remainder until no object can
be found to put in the bin.  This is substantially more efficient than
'packByOrder', but requires sorting the input. -}
