   Portability: portable to platforms supporting binary I\/O

This module provides various helpful utilities for dealing with binary
input and output.

You can use this module to deal with binary blocks of data as either Strings
or lists of Word8.  The BinaryConvertible class provides this abstraction.

Wherever you see HVIO, you can transparently substite a regular Handle.
This module can work with any HVIO object, however.  See
"System.IO.HVIO" for more details.

Versions of MissingH prior 0.11.6 lacked the 'BinaryConvertible' class
and worked only with Strings and Handles.

Important note: /binary functions are not supported in all Haskell
implementations/.  Do not import or use this module unless you know you
are using an implementation that supports them.  At this time, here
is the support status:

 * GHC 6.2 and above: yes

 * GHC 6.x, earlier versions: unknown

 * GHC 5.x: no

 * nhc98: no

 * Hugs: partial (maybe complete; needs more testing)

Non-binary functions may be found in "System.IO".
