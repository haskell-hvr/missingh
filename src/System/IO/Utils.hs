newlines as appropriate.  The list is not expected to have newlines already.

{- | Given a handle, returns a list of all the lines in that handle.
Thanks to lazy evaluation, this list does not have to be read all at once.

Combined with 'hPutStrLns', this can make a powerful way to develop
filters.  See the 'lineInteract' function for more on that concept.

Example:

> main = do
>        l <- hGetLines stdin
>        hPutStrLns stdout $ filter (startswith "1") l

on any handle, not just stdin and stdout.

{- | Line-based interaction.  This is similar to wrapping your
interact functions with 'lines' and 'unlines'.  This equality holds:

> lineInteract = hLineInteract stdin stdout

Here's an example:

> main = lineInteract (filter (startswith "1"))

This will act as a simple version of grep -- all lines that start with 1
will be displayed; all others will be ignored.

{- | Line-based interaction over arbitrary handles.  This is similar

One could view this function like this:

>         hInteract finput foutput newf

Though the actual implementation is this for efficiency:

> hLineInteract finput foutput func =
>     do
>     lines <- hGetLines finput
>     hPutStrLns foutput (func lines)
