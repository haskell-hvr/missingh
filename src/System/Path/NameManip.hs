{- | Split a path in components. Repeated \"@\/@\" characters don\'t lead to empty
components. \"@.@\" path components are removed. If the path is absolute, the first component
will start with \"@\/@\". \"@..@\" components are left intact. They can't be simply
removed, because the preceding component might be a symlink. In this case,
'realpath' is probably what you need.

The case that the path is empty, is probably an error. However, it is
treated like \"@.@\", yielding an empty path components list.

Examples:

>slice_path "/"        = ["/"]
>slice_path "/foo/bar" = ["/foo","bar"]
>slice_path "..//./"   = [".."]
>slice_path "."        = []

{- | Split a file name in components. This are the base file name and the
suffixes, which are separated by dots. If the name starts with a dot, it is
regarded as part of the base name. The result is a list of file name
components. The filename may be a path. In this case, everything up to the
last path component will be returned as part of the base file name. The
path gets normalised thereby.

No empty suffixes are returned. If the file name contains several
consecutive dots, they are regared as part of the preceding file name
component.

Concateneting the name components and adding dots, reproduces the
original name, with a normalised path:
@concat . intersperse \".\" . 'slice_filename' == 'normalise'@.

Note that the last path component might be \"@..@\". Then it is not
possible to deduce the refered directory's name from the path. An IO
action for getting the real path is then necessary.

Examples:

@
'slice_filename' \"a.b\/\/.\/.foo.tar.gz\" == [\"a.b\/.foo\",\"tar\",\"gz\"]
'slice_filename' \".x..y.\"             == [\".x.\", \"y.\"]
@

{- | Split a path in directory and file name. Only in the case that the
supplied path is empty, both parts are empty strings. Otherwise, @\".\"@ is filled in
for the corresponding part, if necessary. Unless the path is empty,
concatenating the returned path and file name components with a slash in
between, makes a valid path to the file.

@split_path@ splits off the last path component. This
isn't the same as the text after the last @\/@.

Note that the last path component might be @\"..\"@. Then it is not
possible to deduce the refered directory's name from the path. Then an IO
action for getting the real path is necessary.

{- | Inverse of 'split_path', except for normalisation.

This concatenates two paths, and takes care of @\".\"@ and empty paths. When the two components are the result of @split_path@, then @unsplit_path@
creates a normalised path. It is best documented by its definition:

>unsplit_path (".", "") = "."
>unsplit_path ("", ".") = "."
>unsplit_path (".", q)  = q
>unsplit_path ("", q)   = q
>unsplit_path (p, "")   = p
>unsplit_path (p, ".")  = p
>unsplit_path (p, q)    = p ++ "/" ++ q

Examples:

>unsplit_path ("", "")     == ""
>unsplit_path (".", "")    == "."
>unsplit_path (".", ".")   == "."
>unsplit_path ("foo", ".") == "foo"

{- | Split a file name in prefix and suffix. If there isn't any suffix in
the file name, then return an empty suffix. A dot at the beginning or at
the end is not regarded as introducing a suffix.

The last path component is what is being split. This isn't the same as
splitting the string at the last dot. For instance, if the file name
doesn't contain any dot, dots in previous path component's aren't mistaken
as introducing suffixes.

The path part is returned in normalised form. This means, @\".\"@ components
are removed, and multiple \"@\/@\"s are reduced to one.

Note that there isn't any plausibility check performed on the suffix. If the file name doesn't have a suffix, but happens to contain a dot, then this
dot is mistaken as introducing a suffix.

Examples:

>split_filename "path/to/foo.bar"                             = ("path/to/foo","bar")
>split_filename "path/to/foo"                                 = ("path/to/foo","")

>split_filename "a///./x"                                     = ("a/x","")
>split_filename "dir.suffix/./"                               = ("dir","suffix")
