What is MissingH?
-------------------------

It's a collection of Haskell-related utilities.  It is an extension of my
earlier work developing MissingLib for OCaml.  You can download
MissingH from http://software.complete.org/missingh.  There is a mirror, with
a few days' lag, at http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/missingh.

-------------------------
Major Features
-------------------------

 * Powerful Logging Framework for Haskell
   This framework provides a system of hierarchical loggers and
   modular handlers permitting fine-grained logging with a great deal
   of control and yet a simple and fast interface.  It's based on
   log4j for Java and logging for Python.

   Also included is a native-Haskell Syslog client.

 * Versatile modules to simplify everyday tasks:
   + FTP client library
   + E-mail client library
   + MIME types library to determine MIME types from files or URLs
   + Configuration file parser/generator

 * IO utilities make it easier to work with line-based text files
   and binary files

 * IO object virtualization so you can use one set of code to work
   on files of many different types

 * Filesystem virtualization so you can access variuos items with the
   same ease as your system's filesystem

 * Network utilities to streamline connections

 * List utilities including association list tools,
   list splitting, truncation, and delimiter joining

 * String utilities including removal of leading or trailing
   whitespace, joining, splitting, and truncation

 * Other utilities for threads, parers, filenames, etc.

 * Printf utilities for formatting strings

 * GZip decompression

 * Hundreds of unit tests to verify proper functionality

library and is designed to install without complexity on a variety of
systems.  It could also easily be embedded within your own source
trees so that users need not have it installed beforehand.

** THIS IS CURRENTLY BETA-QUALITY CODE; MAJOR API FLUCTUATIONS MAY YET OCCUR.

-------------------------
Quick Start
-------------------------

See the file INSTALL (Linux/Unix/BSD/Posix) or INSTALL-win.txt (Windows).

-------------------------
Usage in programs
-------------------------

You can simply use -package MissingH in most compilers to enable
this library.  

Hugs users will need to use -98 +o to use certain modules.

GHC users will need to use this for certain modules:
 -fallow-overlapping-instances -fallow-undecidable-instances \
 -fglasgow-exts

The API docs can be built with "make doc", or you can find them at:
