-------------------------
What is MissingH?
-------------------------

It's a collection of Haskell-related utilities.  It is an extension of my
earlier work developing MissingLib for OCaml.  

-------------------------
Major Features
-------------------------

 * Powerful Logging Framework for Haskell
   This framework provides a system of hierarchical loggers and
   modular handlers permitting fine-grained logging with a great deal
   of control and yet a simple and fast interface.  It's based on
   log4j for Java and logging for Python.

   Also included is a native-Haskell Syslog client.

 * Versatile modules to simplify everyday tasks:
   + FTP client library
   + E-mail client library
   + MIME types library to determine MIME types from files or URLs
   + Configuration file parser/generator

 * IO utilities make it easier to work with line-based text files
   and binary files

 * Network utilities to streamline connections

 * List utilities including association list tools,
   list splitting, truncation, and delimiter joining

 * String utilities including removal of leading or trailing
   whitespace, joining, splitting, and truncation

 * Other utilities for threads, parers, filenames, etc.

 * Printf utilities for formatting strings

 * GZip decompression

 * Hundreds of unit tests to verify proper functionality

The following modules are are provided at this time, and more are
likely to follow:

MissingH.Bits            * Obtain individual bytes from a bitfield

The entire library has no prerequisites save the Haskell standard
library and is designed to install without complexity on a variety of
systems.  It could also easily be embedded within your own source
trees so that users need not have it installed beforehand.

** THIS IS CURRENTLY BETA-QUALITY CODE; MAJOR API FLUCTUATIONS MAY YET OCCUR.
