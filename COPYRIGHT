Special Notes for Included Code

MissingH includes some code from other authors.  The copyright and license

simply know that the GPL should be understood to cover the entire library.

If you split out the parts originally from other authors, and use them
completely independently of the rest of the library, you may treat them
under the licenses shown below.
